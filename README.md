# SimpleGeneticAlgorithm
here it is a simple genetic algorithm that was implemented by myself 
## what it can do?
the algorithm make random population and then in lots of generations try to reach a special string
the number of population,generation and result string can be changed by yourself...
## how to use 
there are two ways to eun the algorithm 
### first one with python file
+ first you need to install some packages with pip install i list below: 
  + pip install wheel
  + pip install freez
  + pip install fuzzywuzzy
  + pip install python-Levenshtein
+ then its all done and you only need to run the file python file Genetic.py
### second one with jupyter notebook
- you only need to open Genetic.ipnyb file with jupyter notebook and run cells in order one by one
