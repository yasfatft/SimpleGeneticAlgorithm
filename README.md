# Genetic Algorithm
## What it can do?
The algorithm makes a random population at the beginning and then tries to approach a special string in every generation.
Population size, number of generations, and goal string can be modified by you.
## How to use 
There are two ways to run algorithm: 
### With Python3
1. Install dependencies: 
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
2. Declare population size, number of generation & goal string in genetic.py
2. Run genetic.py
### With Jupiter Notebook
You only need to open the Genetic.ipnyb with Jupiter notebook, modify population size, number of generation & goal string, and run cells in order one by one.
